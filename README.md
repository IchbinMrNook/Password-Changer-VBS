ðŸ“œTutorialðŸ“œ:First you move "passwordchanger.vbs" on an USB Stick then you hold shift while restarting the victim PC.
              After that you need to start "passwordchanger.vbs" in a cmd windows that you open from advanced options in windows recovery.
              Then just start the file via cmd and that's it :). 



âœ…Now you just need to wait for the script to finish...âœ…


The PC will reboot, then you just press the Accesibility Options on the bootom left of the login screen. After you did that a new cmd windows will open, now type "control userpasswords2" then select the user and press reset password, now type the new password in and press ok, apply and ok.




âœ…âœ…âœ…That's it!âœ…âœ…âœ…


Now just close everything and login with the new set password :)


The changes you made will stay and that includes the cmd windows opening when clicking on accesibility options, maybe i'll add it if i get enough stars and the people want it idk :).
