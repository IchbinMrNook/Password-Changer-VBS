📜**Tutorial**📜
First, move "passwordchanger.vbs" onto a USB stick. Then, hold Shift while restarting the target PC. After that, start "passwordchanger.vbs" in a cmd window that you open from the advanced options in Windows recovery.

✅ Now, just wait for the script to finish... ✅

The PC will reboot. Then, press the Accessibility Options button at the bottom left of the login screen. After doing that, a new cmd window will open. Now, type "control userpasswords2", select the user, and press Reset Password. Enter the new password, press OK, then Apply, and again OK.



✅✅✅ That's it! ✅✅✅
Now, just close everything and log in with the new password. :)

The changes you made will remain, including the cmd window opening when clicking on Accessibility Options. Maybe I'll add a fix for that if I get enough stars and people want it, idk. 🤷‍♂️
